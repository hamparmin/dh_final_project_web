          <h1 class="heading">The Great Water Regulation</h1>
          <p class="paragraph-3">Dubbed as the second &quot;conquest&quot; of the Carpathian Basin, the water regulations that took place in the second half of the nineteenth century are collectively remembered as a national milestone, carrying Hungary into the modern era. Engineers and heads of planning committees are hailed as national heroes and preserved in the collective memory with statues and squares named after them. There is no doubt about the awe-inspiring scale of the construction of new dams, dikes, and riverbeds. Hungary&#x27;s longest river, the Tisza, had its length curtailed from 955 to 579 kilometers. While one of the most expensive infrastructure projects to this day, in the past few decades, the rationale for the water regulations&#x27; economic and social benefits started to be questioned. Economists, ethnographers, and ecologists have raised concerns regarding the historical effects of the water regulation on affected communities and the environment. In this essay, I attempt to consolidate these concerns to paint a more realistic picture of costs and investments. By analyzing the background and consequences of the 1870 to 1890 water regulations in the 25,000 square kilometers of the river Tisza&#x27;s flood basin, I intend to shed light on some of the greatest silences from the history of Hungary&#x27;s modernization.<br></p>

        <h1>The Rationale</h1>
        <p>The Tisza Valley, part of the Great Hungarian Plains, is the flood basin of the River Tisza that brings enormous amounts of freshwater from the Carpathian mountains into Hungary&#x27;s lowlands. The Great Hungarian Plains&#x27; extreme flatness leads to a river dotted with meanders and oxbow lakes (former meanders that have been naturally disconnected from the main riverbed). The river is also languid with low loads, resulting in a continually changing and shallow riverbed. Combined with the rapid spring and early summer snow and rainfall in its drainage basin mountains, flooding is a natural part of the Tisza&#x27;s annual water cycle. Until the late nineteenth century&#x27;s water regulation, the Tisza would sustain permanent and semi-permanent wetlands as big as 25,000 square kilometers or a quarter of Hungary&#x27;s total territory. The Great Hungarian Plains&#x27; otherwise dry climate was counterbalanced by the amount of water sitting in these wetlands. The large amounts of organic deposit of the river allowed for an effective polyculture of animal husbandry, fishery, and small-scale crop cultivation. While the economy of the region was mostly self-sufficient, it&#x27;s low population, and pre-industrial agricultural methods made it economically insignificant [1].</p>

          <figcaption>Count Istvan Szechenyi</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>‍<br></p>
        <p>The first person to propose the need for the regulation of the Tisza river was Count Istvan Szecheny, a nobleman of the Hungarian Kingdom and a leading industrialist of his time. Witnessing a series of floods over the 1830s, which had devastating effects on the newly urbanized, larger Tisza Valley towns, such as Szolnok or Szeged, he projected the river to be a constant obstacle to the industrial growth of the country [2]. While his plans at the time were not seriously considered for their immense scope, the 1848 revolution against the Habsburg rule over the country has turned the tables. Following the defeat of the Hungarian War of Independence that grew out of the revolution, the Imperial Court in Vienna recognized the Tisza wetlands&#x27; strategic importance in hiding revolutionary troops and preventing adequate military supervision of these areas. While the plans to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; turned irrelevant following the 1867 Austro-Hungarian Compromise, Vienna&#x27;s engineering plans were not lost.</p>
        <p>‍</p>
        <p>Szechenyi&#x27;s vision of catastrophic floods came true in 1869, when the city of Szeged was destroyed by an icy-flood, killing hundreds and leaving 60,000 without homes. This natural disaster rekindled the discussion about the regulation of the river and resulted in the formation of a national commission, led by Pal Vasarhelyi, one of Szechenyi&#x27;s followers [3]. Under his leadership, the commission delivered an engineering proposal to separate the Tisza and its organic wetlands by cutting them off with dikes. The commission also took it upon themselves to lobby for approval of the project and see to the collectivization of its fundings. The economic argument pressed by Vasarhelyi emphasized the potential of the transformation of the wetlands into crop fields. While entirely self-sufficient, Hungary held the capacity to achieve a five-fold increase in its cereal exports. The high prices of grain in other, conflict ridden areas of Europe, convinced many landowners to support Vasarhelyi&#x27;s plan [2]. Furthermore, effective prevention of floods incentivized large towns to contribute and effectively bear the costs of at least half of the works. Between 1870 and 1914, the area of arable land grew by a staggering 50,000 square kilometers, thanks to such water regulation projects as that of the Tisza. Crop yields consequently quadrupled in that period and have significantly contributed to the turn-of-the-century economic growth of the country.</p>

        <p>The last sentence is where perhaps most public education on the topic ends. Unfortunately, there seems to be overwhelming evidence against claiming the water regulation projects a success and the idolization of figures such as Szechenyi or Vasarhelyi for propelling the country into modernity. We rarely hear about the costs of these projects, be it economic, social, or environmental.</p>

        <h1>Economic Impact</h1>
        <p>The constant upheaval from armed conflicts across Europe through the nineteenth century led to the price of wheat, the main crop grown in the place of the Tisza wetlands, and other cereals to fluctuate. In the 1870s, the time of the launch of the water regulation constructions, the Franco-Prussian War and the Great Financial Panic of 1873 kept the export prices of wheat high and consequently allowed for landowners to increase exports to foreign customs areas, such as France, Spain or the United Kingdom [4]. As table 1 shows, the volume of these exports increased fifteen-fold between 1880 and 1900, compared to their pre-1870 levels. These years were extraordinarily profitable and contributed to the country&#x27;s further industrialization, such as large-scale railroad constructions and urban investment. However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, they started to decline due to Hungary&#x27;s disadvantaged market position. The country&#x27;s landlocked position meant that shipping via waterways was not always possible. While the shipping of grains via the Danube told easy access to Central European countries, to access Western European markets ships from the Danube and Tisza (a tributary of the former) would have had to go through the Black Sea or shipped via the railway to Rijeka&#x27;s harbor on the Adriatic Sea. As transatlantic transport costs fell by 45% on average between 1870 and 1909, American wheat rendered Hungary uncompetitive outside of its Central European local market [2].</p>

        </figure>
        <p><br></p>
        <p>From this perspective, the waterway regulations fell short in contributing to the country&#x27;s long-term economic stability. What is worse is that this period&#x27;s financial gains only marginally affected most people living in the Tisza Valley [4]. While the 1848 War of Independence abolished serfdom, most farmers in the Great Hungarian Plains remained in de facto servitude to larger landowners, meaning that they rarely saw any profit for themselves. As the water regulation and the transformation of the land resulted in the dramatic reformulation of the landscape, many lost their livelihoods as their professions became irrelevant. The Tisza&#x27;s regulation transformed the polyculture economic production into a monoculture, making the area and its people more vulnerable to external economic shocks. To date, this area is one of the poorest and least developed in the country [1].</p>

        <h1>Environmental Impact</h1>
        <p>It would be misleading to say that the Tisza Valley floodplains were free of human intervention before the nineteenth century&#x27;s water regulation projects. Settlements in this area date back to the 10th century and the inhabitants of the floodplains have utilized the rich biodiversity of the area to build self-sustaining economies [5]. The floodplains of the Tisza Valley, created by regular inundations, range anywhere from 5 to 50 kilometer in both directions from the riverbanks [1]. By constructing small brooks from the riverbank and siltation, locals have long manipulated the floodplains&#x27; semi-permanent wetlands to their needs. Such manipulations resulted in the creation of fishing lakes, meadows for livestock, and orchards. The nutrient-rich residue deposited by the meandering river served as fertile ground for fruit trees such as cherry, almond, peach, apricot, and prunes. At the same time, the naturally high lying areas were used to cultivate crops.</p>
        <figure style="max-width:30%" id="w-node-4b93b1cc794c-8a1c38ce" class="w-richtext-align-floatright w-richtext-figure-type-image">

          <figcaption>A section of the Tisza after regulation<br>(1: Floodplain, 2: High Banks, 3: Settlements, 4: Artificial Dikes)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>As topographical maps of the historical riverbank show, settlements have all formed in the Tisza Valley&#x27;s natural high banks. Some villages stand out as little islands in the middle of floodplains, providing evidence for the floodplain economy&#x27;s rich yields.<br></p>
        <p>The nineteenth-century water regulations destroyed this economy by cutting off the floodplains from the river by dikes. Not only century-old floodplain forests, lakes, and swamps were turned into arable land. The regulations also had a significant impact on the biodiversity of the river itself [2]. As most of the river&#x27;s indigenous species who have adapted to the regular floods and shallow waters, such as fish who would lay their eggs in siltation waters to hatch, had their natural reproductive habitat taken away. Beyond fish, reptiles, amphibians, and bird species have also been endangered by the waterworks, and their natural habitats restricted to the Great Hungarian Plains&#x27; smaller rivers and swamplands. Records of travel by missionaries, explorers, and other travelers often revel in these lands&#x27; richness, such as a 13th-century French monk who claiming that the Tisza is &quot;half water, half fish.&quot; [6]</p>
        <p>In addition to the abundance of nature by the Tisza river, a traditional profession was also lost. Pákászat was a hunter-gatherer profession of the Tisza Valley people who lived a nomadic lifestyle in the deep swamplands trading fish, crayfish, wild bird eggs, otter pelt, and herbs with villagers [7]. The pákász lived in temporary reed huts for 5 to 6 weeks before moving onto a new area to hunt and gather. They either traveled the swamps by boat or snowshoe like footwear, which allowed them to walk on the surface of wet and unstable soil. Spending the entire year in the swampland, the pákász possessed the unique ability to map and traverse otherwise unmappable and inaccessible areas quickly. It was not uncommon for the region&#x27;s outlaws and fugitives to seek the help of a pákász to go into hiding. Such is the story of the famous &quot;betyár&quot; or highwayman of the early nineteenth century, Sándor Rózsa, who hid in the villages and swamps of the Great Hungarian plains for years with the help of different pákász.</p>

          <figcaption>Illustration of a pákász returning to his crayfish trap.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The nineteenth-century water regulations put an end to this &quot;Wild West&quot; like wilderness and lifestyle of the Hungarian Great Plains. What it once was, and what it meant for those living there, we may now only remember through literary works, such as &quot;Tisza&quot; by the national poet Sándor Petőfi. The greatest tragedy of this landscape&#x27;s transformation was that it happened without any in-depth consideration of long-term ecological, societal, or cultural impact. There are just many reasons why we should rethink this megaproject&#x27;s image of being a symbol of Hungary&#x27;s modernization and reconsider our holding of its spearheaders Szechenyi and Vasarhelyi in such high regard.</p>
